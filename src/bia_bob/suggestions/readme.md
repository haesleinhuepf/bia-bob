# Suggestions

In this folder you find BiA-Bob's code suggestions for common image analysis + data science libraries. 
Feedback and pull-requests are welcome! If you are maintaining one of the libraries and think the suggestions would be
better stored and maintained within your library, you can read [here](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/bia-bob?tab=readme-ov-file#extensibility) 
how to do so, without the need to involve the BiA-Bob maintainers.
