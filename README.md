# bia-bob

BIA `bob` is a Jupyter-based assistant for interacting with data using large language models which generate python code. 
It can make use of [OpenAI's chatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api), [Google's Gemini](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai/) and [Helmholtz' blablador](https://helmholtz-blablador.fz-juelich.de/). 
You need an OpenAI API account or a Google Cloud account or a Helmholtz ID account to use it.

> [!CAUTION]
> When using the OpenAI, Google Gemini API or any other endpoint via BiA-Bob, you are bound to the terms of service 
> of the respective companies or organizations.
> The prompts you enter are transferred to their servers and may be processed and stored there. 
> Make sure to not submit any sensitive, confidential or personal data. Also using these services may cost money.

## Usage

You can initialize `bob` like this:
```
from bia_bob import bob
```

### Code generation

You can ask Bob to generate code like this:
```
%bob Load blobs.tif and show it
```

It will then respond with a python code snippet that you can execute ([see full example](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/bia-bob/blob/main/demo/analysis_workflow.ipynb)):

### Bug fixing

Bob can fix simple bugs in code you executed. Just add `%%fix` on top of the cell right after the error happened.

### Code documentation

Using the `%%doc` magic, you can generate documentation for a given code cell.

### No-code custom Jupyter Kernel

If installed, you can also choose the BiA-Bob from the Launcher in Jupyter lab:

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/bia-bob/raw/main/docs/images/bia-bob-custom-kernel.png)

This will give you a Jupyter kernel that allows you to type in English language instead of code:

## Known issues

If you want to ask `bob` a question, you need to put a space before the `?`.

```
%bob What do you know about blobs.tif ?
```

## Installation

You can install `bia-bob` using pip. it is recommended to install it into via conda/mamba environment. If you have never used conda before, please [read this guide first](https://biapol.github.io/blog/mara_lampert/getting_started_with_mambaforge_and_python/readme.html).  

It is recommended to install `bia-bob` in a conda-environment together with useful tools for bio-image analysis. 

```
mamba env create -f https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/bia-bob/raw/main/environment.yml
```

You can then activate this environment...

```
mamba activate bob_env
```

... and install `bia-bob`.

### Using OpenAI as backend
```
pip install bia-bob openai
```
(Recommended openai version >= 1.2.0)

Create an OpenAI API Key and add it to your environment variables as explained on [this page](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5112595-best-practices-for-api-key-safety).

### Using blablador as backend

You can alternatively use the [blablador endpoint](https://helmholtz-blablador.fz-juelich.de/), a service provided by the Helmholtz foundation. 
For this, just install the openai backend as explained above (tested version: 1.5.0) and get an API key as explained on
[this page](https://sdlaml.pages.jsc.fz-juelich.de/ai/guides/blablador_api_access/). 
Store this API key in the environment variable `BLABLADOR_API_KEY`. 
For testing this endpoint, you need to initialize bob like [shown in this notebook](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/bia-bob/blob/main/demo/blablador.ipynb):

```
bob.initialize(endpoint='blablador', model='Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2')
```

### Using Google's Cloud AI API as backend

```
pip install bia-bob google-cloud-aiplatform
```
(Recommended google-cloud-aiplatform version >= 1.38.1)

To make use of the Google Cloud API, you need to create a Google Cloud account [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome/) and
a project within the Google cloud (for billing) [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate). 
You need to store authentication details locally as explained [here](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc#local-dev). 
This requires installing [Google Cloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install). In very short: run the installer and when asked, activate the "Run gcloud init' checkbox. Or run 'gcloud init' from the terminal yourself. Restart the terminal window.
After installing Google Cloud CLI, start a terminal and authenticate using: 
```
gcloud auth application-default login
```
Follow the instructions in the browser. Enter your Project ID (not the name). If it worked the terminal should approximately look like this:

### BiA-Bob Jupyter kernel (optional)

If you want to use the BiA-Bob Jupyter kernel, please run additionally this command:

```
python -m bia_bob install
```

You can check if it's installed by printing out the list of installed kernels:

```
jupyter kernelspec list
```

And you can uninstall them using this command:

```
jupyter kernelspec uninstall bia-bob
```

## Development

If you want to contribute to `bia-bob`, you can install it in development mode like this:

```
git clone https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/bia-bob.git
cd bia-bob
pip install -e .
```

## Extensibility

If you are maintainer of a Python library and want to make BiA-bob aware of functions in your library, you can extend Bob's knowledge using [entry-points](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/entry-points/). Add this to your library `setup.cfg`:
```

[options.entry_points]
bia_bob_plugins =
    plugin1 = your_library._bia_bob_plugins:list_bia_bob_plugins

```

In the above mentioned `_bia_bob_plugins.py` define this function (and feel to rename the function and the Python file):
```
def list_bia_bob_plugins():
    """List of function hints for bia_bob"""
    return """
    * Computes the sum of a and b
    your_library.compute_sum(a:int,b:int) -> int
    
    * Determines the difference between a and b
    your_library.compute_difference(a:int, b:int) -> int
    
    """
```

Note that the syntax should be pretty much as shown above: A bullet point with a short description and a code-snippet just below. 
You can also generate the `list_bia_bob_plugins` function as demonstrated in [this notebook](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/stackview/blob/c87b59b896aeef9c0b60928b169027d1480c14e9/docs/generate_bia_bob_connector.ipynb).
Please only list the most important functions. If the list of all plugins extending BiA-Bob becomes too long, the prompt will exceed the maximum prompt length.

List of known Python libraries that provide extensions to Bob:
* [pyclesperanto-prototype](https://github.com/clEsperanto/pyclesperanto_prototype)
* [stackview](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/stackview)
